# ioinstrs.py  10/07/2016  D.J.Whale
#
# Placeholder for extended IO hardware instructions

# Will refactor extract
# dispatcher for IOInstructions

# Also, runtime registration of these 3 instrutions into the instruction.py tables
# will need to be done here, so that instruction.py is not polluted with non standard
# features. But only if the instructions need mnemonic names other than IO 03 etc
