# hltinstrs.py  10/07/2016  D.J.Whale
#
# Placeholder for extra HLT instructions

# Will refactor extract:
# HLT 01.. HLT  99

# Also, runtime registration of these instructions into the instruction.py tables
# will need to be done here, so that instruction.py is not polluted with non standard
# features. (but only if they have names, if they are just HLT 01.. HLT 99 then
# the instruction.py won't need changing)


# END
