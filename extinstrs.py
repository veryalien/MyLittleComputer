# extinstrs.py  10/07/2016  D.J.Whale
#
# Placeholder for extended instructions

# Will refactor extract:
# USB
# MUL
# DIV

# Also, runtime registration of these 3 instrutions into the instruction.py tables
# will need to be done here, so that instruction.py is not polluted with non standard
# features.
