# Placeholder for extended instructions

import extarch # for b_flag and b_reg
import instruction

# Will refactor extract:
# USB
# MUL
# DIV

# Also, runtime registration of these 3 instrutions into the instruction.py tables
# will need to be done here, so that instruction.py is not polluted with non standard
# features.

# 5xx instructions are not defined, so these are USER instructions,
# The whole range from 500 to 599 are free for user use. U + 00
# to U + 99 can be used to add specific instruction extensions,
# such as bitwise operators and other useful facilities that would
# not normally be done with OS calls.
